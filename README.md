# oddjob #

oddjob is a lightweight, command line controlled web server.  Built for
development and testing purposes, it can be used to serve static content for
local web development.  It was created when web browsers stopped allowing the
loading of pages from your local file system.

oddjob also has basic file upload capabilities built in. You can POST directly
to the */oj_upload* URL and oddjob will accept the uploaded files.  The default
upload behaviour is to print out the entire upload POST request and then the
contents off each uploaded file on oddjob's STDOUT. This is useful for small
tests uploading text files, but if you need to upload large or binary files you
can tell oddjob to save the files to a directory instead. If you upload and
save the same file twice oddjob will not overwrite existing saved files,
instead a unique name is generated by adding a number to the end of the file's
name.

It is easy to hack the oddjob script to build quick test jigs for web
development. Sometimes using a simple test web server is easier than working
with a full fledged development or production environment.

## Usage ##

Run oddjob with the *-h* or *--help* options to see a full description of the
command usage. oddjob also serves a short information page at the
*/oj_info* URL that includes the command usage.

To stop oddjob use the normal interrupt key combination (usually Ctrl-C).

## Examples ##

    oddjob

Serves the files and directories in your current working directory at the
*http://localhost:4400/* URL.  File upload is available at
*http://localhost:4400/oj_upload*

    oddjob -p 2222 -o ./uploads ./my-site

Serves the contents of the *./my-site* directory at the
*http://localhost:2222/* URL, file upload is available at
*http://localhost:2222/oj_upload* files are saved to the
*./uploads* directory.

## Environment ##

oddjob is written in ruby and its only required dependency is a standard ruby
install. No extra gems are required.  oddjob makes use of the built in ruby
web server library [webrick](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/webrick/rdoc/WEBrick.html).
oddjob has been tested with ruby 1.8.7 and up.

## Security ##

By default oddjob only serves to clients on localhost (that is: browsers
running on the same computer as oddjob).  The *-a* option will allow
connections from any hosts. If you do not trust the users on your local network
the *-a* option could be a security concern.  Anyone who could connect to your
IP address could also browse the files served by oddjob.

oddjob will serve the contents of the directory specified on the command line,
or the current working directory if no directory is specified. It does no
filtering on the contents of the directory served, and the entire directory
tree below the top level directory is available for browsing.

oddjob will bind to port 4400 by default. A different port can be specified
with the *-p* option.

oddjob is available for public use and is supplied as is, with no implied
warranty or fitness for any purpose whatsoever.
